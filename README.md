  Comment Section App
</h1>

A functional comment section app built with React using Google's Material UI Design components. The app allows users to add comments, reply to a comment thread, and like comments. Users can also delete their comments after creating them.<br/><br/>

## Future Plans
If I have time to come back to this project, I plan to add the following features:
- **Edit Comments**: Allow users to edit their comments after creating them.
- **Filters**: Change the order of comments based on date or likes.
- **Comment Database**: Save the comments to a database rather than local storage.

## Reflections

I tried separating the component logic from visuals by creating a service file (a folder structure I ). It was an interesting approach, and may be useful when dealing with an api, but If I were to redo this project I would make the service file smaller and add logic back to the components.
